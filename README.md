# Recipe Reviews Data Analysis
This is an in-progress prediction and an open-ended investigation into the recipes dataset that I'm currently working on for the DSC 80 Final Project at UCSD.

# Introduction

This report is based on food.com, a website where home cooks share recipes that they came up with. Reviews are becoming a more and more important part of today's world, where items from movies to restaurants to almost any product are getting reviewed. In this project, I will analyze these reviews in more depth to see whether later reviews are significantly different (i.e more positive or negative) than earlier reviews, in order to help us get a better feel for reviewer behavior. Then, I will see how well we can use this better information about reviews to see if I can predict a recipe's average rating, with only using knowledge beforehand (such as the creator of a recipe, its ingredients etc.)
